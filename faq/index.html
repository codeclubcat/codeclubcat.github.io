    <p><strong>What IS Code Club World?</strong></p>

    <p>Code Club World is a worldwide network of free volunteer-led after-school coding clubs for children aged 9-11.
      It is based on <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk">Code Club UK</a> but the main difference is that volunteer support for
      Code Club World is offered by the volunteer community themselves.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I get involved in Code Club in my country?</strong></p>

    <p>Code Club World is community-led. Where we provide the basic projects and materials, we want you to run the community in your own country. Search online, on the Code Club World website, on Twitter or Facebook, and see whether there already is a community in your country.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I set up a community in my country?</strong></p>

    <p>Use social media to help you find other people who are interested in doing this. Set up a Twitter account for Code Club World in your country.Twitter is great for getting in touch with each other and spreading the word. Maybe use a hashtag for example #CodeClubNorway so that people can find you. Set up a Facebook page for Code Club World in your country, this will help people find each other and it a great place to offer support.</p>

    <p>Use forums to hold conversations. We've had great success using free sites such as Google Groups. It&#8217;s a great way to support each other, ask questions and generally stay in touch with other volunteers.</p>

    <p>Speak to the press to spread the word about your good work. Can you tell your national and local press about Code Club? Maybe they would like to visit some of your clubs?</p>

    <p>Arrange meet-ups for local volunteers. In the UK, many of our volunteers organise regular meet ups, where they can meet other volunteers face-to-face, share experiences, updates and news. It also helps to create a sense of community, so you&#8217;re not just working on your own.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I set up a Code Club?</strong></p>

    <p>If you want to volunteer to run a Code Club, you&#8217;ll need to find somewhere suitable to run one. You&#8217;ll need to find somewhere with adequate computer facilities with access to the internet.</p>

    <p>If you have a suitable venue to run a club, but don&#8217;t feel qualified to teach yourself, then you&#8217;ll need to find a suitable volunteer!</p>

    <p>See below for more details on how to do both of these.</p>

    <p><strong>I have a suitable venue but I can&#8217;t teach. What can I do?</strong></p>

    <p>If you have a venue suitable for running a Code Club - a school, a library, a youth centre, for example - but you don't feel qualified to run a club yourself then you'll need to find a volunteer.</p>

    <p>Chat to friends. Email or write home to parents or to local newspapers and community websites. Use Twitter, Facebook, Forums or anything else you can think of.</p>

    <p>You'll need to meet with your volunteer and talk about how to take it forward. Agree on a day of the week and a time.</p>

    <p><strong>I can teach but I don&#8217;t have a place to run a club. What can I do?</strong></p>

    <p>If you want to volunteer to run a Code Club, you&#8217;ll need to find somewhere suitable to run one. You&#8217;ll need to find somewhere with adequate computer facilities with access to the internet.</p>

    <p>Primary schools in the UK have been highly successful as students can learn with their friends and grow and develop together. Libraries and community centres, too, might be a good place to run one outside of school hours and weekends.</p>

    <p>The important thing is to contact the venue directly, and organise to meet them face-to-face. Explain what Code Club is and take along any relevant materials. Then you can propose a regular day and time to set up your club! Then register your club on this website and download the materials from Github.</p>

    <p><strong>The materials aren&#8217;t available in my language! What should I do?</strong></p>

    <p>Code Club World is community-led, therefore we rely on the good-nature of our volunteers to help translate the materials. If you think you can translate it yourself, or know someone who is able and willing to, then great! The more languages our materials are available in the better.</p>

    <p>If you can&#8217;t translate yourself, or can&#8217;t find anyone who can, why not put a call out on twitter or any forums.</p>

    <p><strong>What software do I need?</strong></p>

    <p>We start with Scratch. At present, our projects are designed to run on Scratch 1.4 as Scratch 2.0 requires an internet connection and uses Flash, and we want to make Code Club available to the most people possible! We&#8217;ll update the projects when the downloadable version of Scratch 2.0 is released later in 2013.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there legal requirements?</strong></p>

    <p>In the UK any adult who wishes to work with children must have a background criminal record check conducted. This varies from country to country, so you should check with your own country&#8217;s laws and make sure you comply with them.</p>

    <p>You may also need to have insurance.</p>

    <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>

    <p>Code Club is and always will be free! It&#8217;s one of our core beliefs and we aim to keep it this way. Code Clubs should be totally volunteer-led, so please don&#8217;t charge for your clubs!</p>

    <p><strong>Where can I get support?</strong></p>

    <p>We&#8217;re a very small operation here in the UK and don&#8217;t have the resources to offer support outside this small island. If you need support look for your country&#8217;s Code Club community. Is there already a Code Club website in your country? Look for your country&#8217;s community on Twitter or on Google Groups. It might be that there are people out there who can help you.</p>
